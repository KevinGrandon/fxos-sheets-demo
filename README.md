# FirefoxOS Sheet Transition Demo

## Usage

The easiest way to install these apps are to symlink them to the outoftree_apps folder inside of a FirefoxOS gaia checkout. Once symlinked, you will need to run ```make install-gaia``` to install them to your device.

Launch the newly installed contacts test app to see the sheets transition.
